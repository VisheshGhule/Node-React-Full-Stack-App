# Kubernetes Deployment & Secure CI/CD Pipeline Implementation for Full-Stack Applications

- We'll explore how to set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for our full-stack Node.js and React.js application. We'll create a pipeline script to deploy our application in a Docker container while leveraging SonarQube for code quality checks, OWASP Dependency Check for examining code dependencies and security vulnerabilities, and Trivy for conducting a comprehensive security scan of our Docker images. Additionally, we'll employ Trivy to scan files for security risks. Through these tools, we'll ensure the security of our project's deployment.

-  we'll configure email notifications to receive alerts about our pipeline's build stage results. Whether the build succeeds or fails, Jenkins will automatically notify us via email once the build stage is complete.
The exciting part is deploying our application on Kubernetes! We'll deploy it as both a Docker container and a Kubernetes container. For Kubernetes deployment, we'll create deployment and service manifest files.
